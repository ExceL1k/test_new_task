* 1.0.0 (2023-03-30)
    * The tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed.

    * Task 5
        Here are a few possible solutions to your problem:

        * Splitting the File and Using Separate Processes:

            Obtain the file and divide it into "chunks" that can be processed separately.
            Execute these chunks in separate processes to speed up object creation.
            This approach can improve performance by parallelizing the task.

        * Using OCA Job Queue Module:

            Download and use the OCA Job Queue module.
            Instead of creating objects directly, create them within separate jobs and set a queue.
            This can help address the issue of object creation time and logging.
            Each object can be tracked individually, making it easier to manage and retry in case of errors.
            To provide a specific implementation, more information about the task would be necessary.

        There are other potential implementation options as well, but they would require more detailed information to address the problem effectively.

        As for estimating the time required for development, if you are starting from scratch with no existing codebase, it might take approximately 2-3 days for development and around 1 day for testing. However, these estimates can vary depending on the complexity of the task and other factors.
